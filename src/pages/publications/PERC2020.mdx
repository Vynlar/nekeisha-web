### Background
---

Successful manipulation of vector quantities is
critical to success in introductory physics courses.
Prior work has demonstrated key aspects of these
struggles, highlighting that more than 1 in 4
students were unable to add two-dimensional
vectors following a year of instruction [1] and
students tend to stick with one method of solving,
even when another method may be more
appropriate [2]. We use module analysis to examine
if students make consistent mistakes across
different types of vector problems.

<br />

### Methods
---

1. Data were collected from four classes of introductory physics students (algebra-based, physics I and II) who responded to a series of multiple-choice, one-dimensional vector addition and subtraction questions
2. Using Module Analysis for Multiple Choice Responses [3] the results for each individual course were plotted as a network and local communities were found.
3. These communities were then analyzed across all four courses, to examine stability of the groupings. This stability is represented visually as a heat map (at right)

<br />

### Naming Scheme
---

The naming scheme defines responses as the
operation prompt (±), the set of original vectors A
and B (1-6), and the directions of A and B that could
be properly added to yield the given resultant
vector (:±A±B).

<br />

### Results
---

The brightest patches in the heat map were
examined to identify any possible trends. Of these
bright patches, we find five groups:

1. 7 responses, with 4 that follow the same pattern (-Q:-A+B)
2. 6 responses, with 5 that follow the same pattern (-Q:+A+B)
3. 6 responses, with 4 that are related as both (+Q:-A-B) and (-Q:-A-B) for questions – that is, two identical sets of vectors
4. 6 responses, with 4 that match a single pattern (+Q:+A-B)
5. 5 responses, with 4 that follow the same pattern (-Q:-A-B)

We offer plausible explanations for the trends in
each of these groups in the full paper

## More Details

### Future Work

- Two of the classes that took this assessment also had a variety of two-dimensional questions, which are being analyzed using the same process.
- A later class was given handwritten versions of some of the two-dimensional questions, which we hope will aid in classifying the groups we find from the two-dimensional multiple-choice questions

##### Example question

Question (“+1”) with each of the four
responses. In this case, option a) is (+1:+A+B),
option b) is (+1:+A-B), option c) is (+1:-A-B), and
option d) is (+1:-A+B).

##### Percent Correct

Comparison of percentage of students getting each
problem correct across all four courses. Students
performed much better on addition than
subtraction.
